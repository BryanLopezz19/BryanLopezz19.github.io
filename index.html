    <p class="aboutMe">My name is Bryan Lopez and I'm currently in the 11th grade at Pasadena High School and I'm in the App Academy. I enjoy playing soccer with friends and family. My favorite class is math. I'm good at solving problems that are difficult and I enjoy that. When I'm done with high school I would like to be in a college that has any type of engineering program. The types of engineering i'm interested in is mechanical, automobile and electrical.</p>
