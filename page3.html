    <p class="aboutMe">This project is Beauty and the Beast. I did this project in my english class sophomore year. In part one of this project we had to know the childhood of the main characters in the story. As well as finding out what the call to the adventure was, and her threshold. Part 2 is the initiation, her supernatural helpers, the special weapon she uses, the abyss, the transformation, and her return home.</p>
